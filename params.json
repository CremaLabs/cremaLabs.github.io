People use Crema to figure out what coffee shops are near them, and to see which ones have available seats (and wifi) and which ones do not.  After logging in, users are taken to a map view displaying nearby coffee shops.  The color of the marker indicates availability information at a glance, but the user can click the marker or access a separate list view of the shops for more details. Users are also able to submit an availability rating for a coffee shop they are in.\r\n####Crema's front end is built with Angular 2 and Typescript, Ionic 2 and Cordova. Ionic 2 is a framework that allows for web facing HTML and CSS to be rendered in a phone application as a hybrid application, rather than native.  Cordova is a platform with plugin modules that make native phone functionality available to hybrid applications.  We are using Cordova to use the native Google Map technology on phones, as opposed to a web-view map.\r\n\r\n##API Endpoints\r\n###User\r\n###Shops\r\n####`GET /v1/shops/` This results in a call to the `get` function in `shops/shops.controller.js`.  This function initiates a GET request to the Google places API centered on the user's current location.  The request returns an array of JSON data for those coffee shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
