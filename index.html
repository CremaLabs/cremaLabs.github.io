People use Crema to figure out what coffee shops are near them, and to see which ones have available seats (and wifi) and which ones do not.  After logging in, users are taken to a map view displaying nearby coffee shops.  The color of the marker indicates availability information at a glance, but the user can click the marker or access a separate list view of the shops for more details. Users are also able to submit an availability rating for a coffee shop they are in.</h4>

Ionic 2 is a framework that allows for web facing HTML and CSS to be rendered in a phone application as a hybrid application, rather than native.  Cordova is a platform with plugin modules that make native phone functionality available to hybrid applications.  We are using Cordova to use the native Google Map technology on phones, as opposed to a web-view map.</h4>

We store the metrics in the metrics schema which uses a shopID that is provided by google and an availRating with either one or four submitted by the user to describe the business of a cafe. The route's post method works by calling the exported function addRating which looks at <code>req.body</code> and its properties and stores those to the table metrics in our database. The get route  for metrics is not used because in crema-api-server/shops/shops.controller.js, where all the shop ID's are retrieved when the get route for shops is called from the client, the getRatingsForShopsByPlaceIds function is called as well which accumulates an average rating for each coffee shop that is returned from the places api request.</h4>
